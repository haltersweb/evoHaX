        <li>Professor behavior</li>
        <li>professors: some want nothing to do with this.  Educational component</li>
        <li>Rate my professor program: how understanding the professor is</li>
        <li>Excel Compenency: online program which is not accessible</li>

        <li>Some with later: have muscle memory can write but not read</li>
        <li>phonetics: works in theory.  But so much of english isn't phonetics.  Only short words with phonetics.</li>
        <li>pictorial in nature are better.  Possible potential path.</li>
        <li>Typical day: commute is fine.  Send out "handouts".  Professors to speak.  Meet with scribe.  Maybe later will replace with Dragon.</li>
        <li>simulate.  blur faces to represent.  mix up letters and threw in other letters.  Program that takes words and scramble them.</li>
